**A fork of [NoName-exe's Revanced Extended repo](https://github.com/NoName-exe/revanced-extended) made to fix various issues, including mounts not being kept across reboots.**

## Features
 * Keep mounts across reboots
 * Builds Magisk modules with RVX patches for YouTube and YouTube-Music
 * Updated with the latest versions of patches
 * Cleans APKs from unneeded libs to make them smaller
 * Modules are built without human intervention
 * Recompiles the invalid .dex files, allowing a faster usage
 * Modules receive updates from the Magisk app
 * Should not trigger root detections
 * Installs base apks from apkmirror
 * Modules support both Magisk and KernelSU

 ## Notes
* Use [zygisk-detach](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) to prevent Play Store from updating YouTube and YouTube-Music.
